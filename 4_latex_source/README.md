# Latex source
Here we will have the latex source files. I highly recommend that you use latex to write your research.  

| Name         | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1_manuscript | This folder contains the source files for manuscript.        |
| 2_figures    | All the figures for publications must be made in a vector editing program. This folder should contain all the source files for figures. |
| 3_plots      | I recommend everyone to use veusz for 2D plots, as it supports automatic plot updation based on changes in the source data. |
| 10_rebuttal  | This folder contains all the files for the rebuttal.         |

**Note:** 

---

Every submission has two destinations:

- **Review:** If the reviewers like your paper, most likely, they will ask for a review. Once you incorporate all the reviews, you have to prepare a `rebuttal` outlining how you have answered all of their queries. The source files for the rebuttal are provided in the 9_rebuttal folder.
- **Reject:** You have to find a different journal that would better suit your research and submit it there.
